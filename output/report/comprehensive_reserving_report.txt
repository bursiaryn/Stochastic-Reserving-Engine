1. INTRODUCTION TO RESERVING
================================================================================

1.1 PURPOSE OF LOSS RESERVING

Loss reserving is the process of estimating future claims payments for:
  • Claims Reported But Not Settled (RBNS/Case Reserves)
  • Incurred But Not Reported (IBNR)
  • Reopened claims
  • Claims development (increases/decreases)

1.2 LINES OF BUSINESS ANALYZED

This analysis covers three distinct lines of business with different
development patterns:

A. AUTO INSURANCE
   • Characteristics: Fast development, short tail
   • Typical settlement: 80%+ within 2 years
   • Main risks: Bodily injury, property damage
   • Development pattern: Front-loaded

B. WORKERS COMPENSATION  
   • Characteristics: Medium development, medium tail
   • Typical settlement: 65%+ within 3 years
   • Main risks: Medical, indemnity, rehabilitation
   • Development pattern: Steady decline

C. GENERAL LIABILITY
   • Characteristics: Slow development, long tail
   • Typical settlement: 40%+ within 5 years
   • Main risks: Bodily injury, property damage, legal
   • Development pattern: Extended tail, potential latent claims

1.3 REGULATORY CONTEXT

This analysis complies with:
  • IFRS 17 (International Financial Reporting Standard)
  • Solvency II (EU regulatory framework)

Assumptions:
  E[C(i,j+1) | C(i,j)] = f(j) × C(i,j)
  Var[C(i,j+1) | C(i,j)] = σ²(j) × C(i,j)

APPENDIX A: TECHNICAL DETAILS
================================================================================

A.1 CHAIN LADDER FORMULA

Age-to-age factor:
  f(j) = Σ C(i, j+1) / Σ C(i, j)

Cumulative development factor:
  CDF(j) = f(j) × f(j+1) × ... × f(n-1)

Ultimate:
  U(i) = C(i, j) × CDF(j)

IBNR:
  IBNR(i) = U(i) - C(i, latest)

A.2 MACK VARIANCE FORMULA

Variance of ultimate:
  Var[U(i)] = C²(i,n-1-i) × Σ [σ²(j) / C(i,j) × (1 + 1/n(j))]

Where:
  σ²(j) = 1/(n-j-1) × Σ C(i,j) × [C(i,j+1)/C(i,j) - f(j)]²
  n(j) = number of observations in column j

Standard error of total reserve:
  SE(R) = sqrt(Σ Var[R(i)] + Σ Var[f(j)] × [Σ C(i,j)]²)

A.3 BOOTSTRAP ALGORITHM

1. Fit chain ladder model → get factors f̂(j)
2. Calculate Pearson residuals:
   r(i,j) = (C(i,j+1) - f̂(j)×C(i,j)) / sqrt(f̂(j)×C(i,j))
3. Adjust for degrees of freedom
4. For each simulation k=1,...,N:
   a. Resample residuals r*(i,j)
   b. Generate pseudo-data: C*(i,j+1) = f̂(j)×C*(i,j) + r*(i,j)×sqrt(f̂(j)×C*(i,j))
   c. Re-estimate factors f̂*(j) from C*(i,j)
   d. Project lower triangle → get R*(k)
5. Build empirical distribution from {R*(1), ..., R*(N)}

A.4 SOLVENCY II RISK MARGIN

RM = CoC × Σ(t=1 to T) SCR(t) × v(0,t)

Where:
  • CoC = 6% (cost of capital rate)
  • SCR(t) = capital requirement at time t
  • v(0,t) = discount factor
  • T = run-off period

Simplified calculation:
  RM ≈ CoC × SCR × Duration / 2

A.5 GLM MODEL SPECIFICATION

Poisson GLM:
  Y(i,j) ~ Poisson(μ(i,j))
  log(μ(i,j)) = α(i) + β(j)

Over-Dispersed Poisson:
  E[Y(i,j)] = μ(i,j)
  Var[Y(i,j)] = φ × μ(i,j)

Where φ > 1 indicates over-dispersion.

Estimation: Maximum likelihood (iteratively reweighted least squares)
